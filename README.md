#  Purchase Request Portal

Welcome to the *Purchase Request Portal* — a simple, clean, and user-friendly web application designed to help employees create purchase requests and supervisors review them efficiently. This project is built using *HTML* and *CSS*, ensuring a smooth and accessible user experience across devices.

## *About the Project*

A Purchase Requisition (PR) is an internal request to procure goods or services. Organizations often struggle with managing these requests due to scattered communication methods like emails or spreadsheets. This portal provides a structured, easy-to-use interface that helps employees submit requests and supervisors approve or reject them, all while keeping the process transparent.
